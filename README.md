# MultipleProcessListener

Listens for started/ended processes and executes whatever you wish, within AutoHotKey scripting.

I use it for activating a specific Windows Power Scheme whenever certain processes are present. Likewise, when all of those processes have non-existent, another Windows Power Scheme is loaded. It is easily changed to doing whatever you like.

Requires AutoHotKey v2.
